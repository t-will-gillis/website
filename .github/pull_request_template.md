<details><summary>Important: PR authors must check their PR for CodeQL annotations/warnings and if found, follow these instructions:</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li> After submitting a pull request, a developer should check for CodeQL code annotations within the pull request comments.  Alerts of severity Medium and lower will not cause GitHub check failure, but they should be resolved prior to proceeding with pull request reviews.  </li>  
<li> DO NOT DISMISS ALERTS.  Alerts should be dismissed only by merge team/dev leads following review of a recommendation  to dismiss. </li> 
<li>In order to determine if/what code changes are required to resolve the alert, read and understand the alert message.  For more information, click "show more details" to view the alert page.  On that page you can click "Show more" to view additional recommendations, example and references.  In order to learn how similar alerts were managed in our repository, browse to [CodeQL alerts](https://github.com/hackforla/website/security/code-scanning) and search for the query (for example "Potentially unsafe external link").  If more help is required, post the question in #hfla-site and if an adequate response is not recieved, send a Slack message to a dev lead.  </li>
<li> If you determine that the alert is a false positive, describe your reasoning below in the section "What changes did you make in response to linter recommendations?".  The alert will be dismissed by a member of the merge team (? or dev lead) following the review of this issue.  </li>
<li> If code changes are required to resolve the alert, the changes will be considered within the scope of the issue.  Make those changes and describe them below in the section "What changes did you make in response to linter recommendations?"</li>
